# <font color="Green">Wind Turbines 2ndâœ‹ - Inventory tool</font>  
The following project consists of a **quick tool for tracking wind turbines in inventory** for small business enterprises. The current code is set up with **Python 3.8 version**. The present case is applied to a fictiony company aimed at repowering wind turbines, ie,  2nd hand wind turbines. 

### Objectives
* Develop a friendly checking inventory tool for 2nd hand wind turbines to be used by warehouse staff.
*Produce a txt file to show the wind turbines in inventory.

### Design
Once upon a time, Vincent Van Gogh said: **"How wonderful yellow is. It stands for the sun."** In our era, Color psychology suggests that the yellow colour owns positive characteristics such as attention-grabbing, energetic, and helpful for reading at last. Therefore, the colour of the characters for the user is **yellow** to compensate for interface limitations. 

The software is a raw tool without images, however, the design includes **symbol emoji** at the beginning and at the end of this tool.

Additionally, the software notifies the user when a wind turbine is added, removed, updated, and exported. Likewise, an exit message is included also.

### Structure
This support tool is built up as follows:
- ### Main Menu: ADD, DELETE, LIST,  UDPATE, EXPORT, & EXIT options. See image 1 below.

- ### LIST option: Display Item(s) in Inventory.

- ### EXIT option: Option to end.
