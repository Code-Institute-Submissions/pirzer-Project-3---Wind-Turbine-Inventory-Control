# <font color="Green">Wind Turbines 2ndâœ‹ - Inventory tool</font>  
The following project consists of a **quick tool for tracking wind turbines in inventory** for small business enterprises. This case recreated a fictiony company orientated to repowering wind turnines.  

### Objectives
* Develop a friendly checking inventory tool to control wind turbine in the warehouse. The information can be printed out in TXT and PDF files. 

### User Stories - UX

- ### As an employee of an inventory department, I would like the following:
  - ### Friendly tool to add wind turbines to the company's inventory.
  - ### Friendly tool to remove wind turbines from the company's inventory.
  - ### Friendly tool to see a quick breakdown of the company's inventory. 
  - ### Friendly tool to update/modify details of the wind turbines in inventory. 
  - ### Friendly tool to print out wind turbines from the company's inventory.
  - ### Friendly option to exit the software.

### Feature Planning - Snapshot.

- ### Smooth user navigation process when the tool is used.
- ### Display current date.
- ### Smooth Add, Remove, Visuallitation, and Update of data for the user. 
- ### Export options of txt & pdf files with a basic breakdown of the data entered by the user(s).
- ### Straight forward option to exit.

### Design
The present software version is a raw tool, i.e., no images. However, it has been included some **symbol emoji** and colours also. The colors used are as follow: **Green, Blue, Cyan, Yellow, and Red**.

The current version offers to the user(s) the following options: ADD items, LIST items, REMOVE items, UPDATE items, PRINT REPORT IN TXT & PDF files.

  ### Implementation
  This tool support structure is as follows:
  - #### Main Menu: ADD, DELETE, LIST,  UDPATE, EXPORT FILES  [PDF & TXT], & EXIT options. See image 1 below.

### Data Model

- #### OOP & class use
The coding includes class level(s) to create different instances depending on user choice and navigation.

- #### Error Handling / Validation
The draft or initial version didn't include any statement or code clause to capture and inform if the user's input were valid or invalid, the print statement was used only. However, there have been included functions and statements to improve the current software version regarding errors detection.

If and try/except statements were implemented all over the coding to handle errors. However, this demands more time testing to detect as many user errors as possible to improve more the code and mitigate issues. See main comments below.

  #### a. The user(s) must type the correct option's number from the main menu, otherwise, an alert message will pop up unit the user select the correct option.
 ##### b. In the sub-menu level, user must input the correct info, otherwise, they will be alert to repeat the operation in red colour and returning to the main menu in all the cases.
 ##### c. if user(s) request any option without a prior data input, the software will alert to the user(s) with an alert in red colour.
  ##### d. The fields of Manufacturer & Model are free of character restrictions due to their input nature. Other input fields have been validated.

- #### Validator Testing
The coding includes class level(s) to create different instances depending on user choice and navigation. See images (9-20) of testing completed below.
